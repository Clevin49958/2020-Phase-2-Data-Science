Yesterday I was at my desk working on some Model 3 stuff, when all of a sudden a fucking bat was flying around my work space. A few of my colleagues were discussing the bat talking about ""Hope that little prick doesn't have rabies"" and ""I hope he doesn't deposit some guano on my laptop"". The little fella looked lost, we knew we had to help him out. 

We all came to the conclusion that this little guy could probably get out if we opened one of the nearby roll-up doors. We figured with an opening big enough, he could use his echo location to find his way out.

The boss walked over to the roll up door, and we waited. Sure enough the little guy found his way out. We cheered, as we were happy this little guy was now free. Then we all got back to work.

You thought I was gonna divulge some company secrets, talk about the batteries, or post a picture from inside huh? Nope. ",16724,2017-07-24 04:33:48,39

[**New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World**](https://www.tesla.com/blog/new-tesla-model-s-now-quickest-production-car-world)
 
The Model S P100D with Ludicrous mode is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.5* seconds. However, both the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder were limited run, million dollar vehicles and cannot be bought new. While those cars are small two seaters with very little luggage space, the pure electric, all-wheel drive Model S P100D has four doors, seats up to 5 adults plus 2 children and has exceptional cargo capacity. 
 
The 100 kWh battery also increases range substantially to an estimated 315 miles on the EPA cycle and 613 km on the EU cycle, making it the first to go beyond 300 miles and the longest range production electric vehicle by far. 
 
The larger battery pack is also available on the Model X, making the world‚Äôs quickest SUV even faster. Model X P100D with Ludicrous mode accelerates to 60 mph in 2.9* seconds and travels up to 289 miles EPA and 542 km EU on a single charge. Model X is also a pure electric SUV and can seat up to seven adults. 
 
Model S and Model X are engineered to be the safest cars on the road and to have the highest ratings from NHTSA. Both have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the freedom to travel long distance for free. And every Tesla will improve over time with free over the air upgrades.

Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled. 

While the P100D Ludicrous is obviously an expensive vehicle, we want to emphasize that every sale helps pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development. Without customers willing to buy the expensive Model S and X, we would be unable to fund the smaller, more affordable Model 3 development.  
 
Expected value using max power mode and Motor Trend benchmark

I talked to a senior reliability engineer at event and held the 1 kg steel ball Franz threw. He said they threw it 5 times the night before with no issue, and suspected microfractures were root cause. Interestingly, they had spare windows on standby and fixed it within 45 minutes. But they chose not to use the fresh windows during event. They also recommended to Elon that he should NOT try it, and instead just stick with the ball drop gag.

I told him that before I crossed over into astronautics, I used to be a blast & ballistics research engineer who tested blast-proof and forced-entry-proof glass for US embassies, so I ended up talking to this guy for like 20-30 minutes, gave him some of my lessons learned and recommendations about fastening, and got a lot of great info from him in return.

Tesla announces full autonomy hardware (AP 2.0) on all production vehicles starting now [Official Thread - Please keep all posts in here],https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/58dprx/tesla_announces_full_autonomy_hardware_ap_20_on/,"**All Tesla Vehicles Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware**
 
Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
 
We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory ‚Äì including Model 3 ‚Äì will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. 

To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses. 
 
Model S and Model X vehicles with this new hardware are already in production, and customers can purchase one today: https://www.tesla.com/autopilot 
 
Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control. As these features are robustly validated we will enable them over-the-air, together with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features. As always, our over-the-air software updates will keep customers at the forefront of technology and continue to make every Tesla, including those equipped with first-generation Autopilot and earlier cars, more capable over time.

I am one of those who got laid off :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ahh91p/i_am_one_of_those_who_got_laid_off/,"I have worked for Tesla for almost 2 years (literally 1 week away from my anniversary) and got laid off today.

I'm heartbroken, and I feel lost. I loved this company more than I've every loved another. I guess I understand the rational, but still....I worked many 80+ hour weeks to get ""essential"" training out to people, and now that's done.

Young lady actually cried in my Tesla today,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9v46bp/young_lady_actually_cried_in_my_tesla_today/,"My wife and I stopped by our local Dunkin Donuts this morning for coffee, and while we were there, one of the young women behind the counter was talking to her two co-workers about our Model S parked outside.

""Did you see that Tesla parked outside? That's my car someday,"" she kept saying to her friends. After we got our drinks, I asked her if she could let someone else take orders for a minute and we could give her a ride in the Tesla. She was speechless, and actually started crying. ""Do you mean it?"" she asked. Sure!

She sat in the passenger's seat and I showed her how the MCU worked. We drove around the parking lot in the shopping mall next door. The whole time, she was so overcome with emotion, she could barely talk. She took pictures the entire time with her phone.

When we got back to the Dunkin, her manager said, ""You made her day."" She said, ""You made my whole week!""

Afterwards, I said to my wife, ""This sort of thing never happened with our Toyota."" :)

Even after having our car for a whole year now, this is my favorite part of owning a Tesla: being able to share the experience with others.

I freed my Tesla from a locked garage with Smart Summon!,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/djatmv/i_freed_my_tesla_from_a_locked_garage_with_smart/,"The other day I parked my Model 3 with Full Self Driving in a free shopping-tenants-only garage in San Diego while attending a work event at a space on the same block. There was nothing to say who the garage belonged to. Just a big PARK sign, a warning that parking is for customers and tenants only, and a sign on the gate saying: ""Gates locked between 11 PM - 7 AM."" There were about 30 stalls and only a few were used. It seemed legit and safe so I left it there for the day.

When I returned around 10 PM, I found the garage to be locked with sliding, full-length chain-link gates. All my co-workers were gone. Actually everyone was gone. There was absolutely no way in. All pedestrian doors were locked. I could see my car through the gate parked perpendicular and about fifty feet from the exit. I frantically searched for a security guard that might let me in, pacing around the garage for about 15 minutes. Insanity! I was losing hope and figured my only solution was to Lyft it home and back in the morning‚Äìa 60 mile round trip‚Äìif I could find one.

Then it hit me: Smart Summon.

I'd played with it a bit in parking lots and understood how it worked. Maybe if I could summon the car to the gate, the electronic sensor would open it? But would that work? And could I get the car to the sensor? And what if I couldn't? Would the car be left in some weird position in the middle of the garage, or blocking the exit? Would I end up leaving it in an even worse position where it would surely be towed first-thing in the morning?

I knew Smart Summon isn't like a remote‚ÄìI couldn‚Äôt steer it left or right, I could only make it come to me. From my experience, it didn't always come exactly where you expected, and sometimes chose a strange route to get there. But I also knew that if I could get it lined up, I could use the regular summon controls: Forward and Reverse. I would be putting a lot of trust in the car, the GPS in my phone and in the car which was indoors.

My heart was pounding, but I was desperate‚Äìand more than a little crazy.

I said a quick prayer to Elon, and launched the Smart Summon feature on my iPhone. I positioned myself directly in front of the exit gate, hoping to get a good GPS lock. It wasn't perfect, so stepped back to get a clearer satellite signal. Finally I felt it had me locked. The computed path showed how the car would back out of the stall, turn to face me, then drive straight towards me. About 50 feet of travel. It looked right.

I took a deep breath and hit summon. The car woke up. Headlights on. Reverse and brake lights on. It slowly and confidently performed the reverse-turn to face me, just like it said it would. It shifted into drive and creeped toward me. It was perfectly aligned with the exit and about three feet from the magnetic loop switch in the concrete that I hoped would trigger the gate. I couldn't believe it. This might work! I decided to switch to the regular summon feature just to make sure the car wouldn't decide to do something crazy. I pressed the FORWARD button. The car continued to inch towards me, silently, like I was gently coaxing some tentative animal to eat food from my hands. The headlights were in my eyes. It was surreal. Slowly the car reached the sensor. Would it work? It rolled further and the gate sprung to life, sliding noisily to my left! I didn't wait, I sprinted through and grabbed the drivers-side door handle. A moment later I was in the car, gate open in front of me. Sweet freedom!

I wish I had video footage. I obviously couldn't record with my phone. I checked my Teslacam feature and found the  recording feature wasn't working (a common ""595 byte file"" bug) and didn't think to hit the record button while making my escape. I'm hoping somewhere a security guard is reviewing footage of this miracle wondering what the hell they're looking at.

Thank you Tesla for this incredible feature! This isn't just about picking you up in the rain, it can legit save you from perilous situations. I never would have thought of this. I took a big gamble and it payed off big time. This car is incredible.

EDIT: Here‚Äôs a [photo of the garage](https://imgur.com/a/4pI8XKn) from the next day. The tenant I was at was on the same block and the signage was ambiguous.

"Police Mode propesition to protect drivers from Cops in traffic stops. Possibly activated by saying something like: ""I'm being pulled over"" in order to turn all cameras and microphones in the car, as well as put a warning on the car's display to let cops know they're being recorded from every angle",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hfv85g/police_mode_propesition_to_protect_drivers_from/,"Requesting this from Tesla to protect their drivers from police abuse in traffic stops. A mode that can be activated through a voice command by saying something like: ""I'm being pulled over"", or even auto activated when the car detects it's being pulled over, all in order to activate all cameras and microphones in the car, and put a warning on the car's display to let the cops know that the car is filming them from every angle. That way they know to act like they're on camera.

This would help all drivers from abuse, not just us minority drivers. But it would aslo greatly help minority drivers like myself from abuse. Because the first time I was pulled over I had a gun pulled on me, and the officer tried to get me out of my car to search it by lying that we were on a private road, as well as threatening to shoot me for reaching for my registration like he asked me to do. Thankfully my cousin who was in the car with me called out the cops lie about the road being a private road by stating that his private school would use the road to drive to their golf practice all the time. As soon as the cop heard that, he put his gun away and ceased from his attempts to search my vehicle. Had my cousin not been there, then I would've been further harassed, or worse. 

But from watching other videos online, every race, even white people, even white lawyers can get harrased, even when filming with their phones. Filming with our phones often agitates cops, and further escalates traffic stop situations when cops often-times ask people to stop filming them, and the people filming do not comply in stopping their filming with their phones for the very well reason of their own safety. 
[Here's an example of a lawyer who was further harassed by police for filming with his phone for his own safety.](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBKO_NgAl64/?igshid=1vwmx4rr3ao5m)


If our cars can film the cops for us, then we can say that that is just what our cars activate automatically when we're pulled over for our own safety, leading the cops to believe we have no control over the car filming them, preventing further escalation of the situation since the cops can't then ask us to stop filming them since it's the car doing it and not us. 

This would significantly drive sales too with people knowing these cars can greatly increase the chances of them not being abused, or worse, killed by police in traffic stop situations.

Edit: [Adding my tweet here in hopes that it can get Elon's attention regarding this feature request](https://twitter.com/InvestlaYT/status/1276563261513662464)

>Edit 2: u/Richfuckingprick suggest a good feature of security for police mode. Quote:

>""make it require a pin number to deactivate. Maybe a double pin(aka a false pin), so if they try to beat the code out of you, you can give them the false pin and disable the system for 24 hours."" (I'm guessing it tells them it deleted it with the false pin, but saves it covertly for the owner, and continues recording covertly? At least that's what I, and many others would recommend, and would feel safe with. Especiallyif your at the point of getting tortured for the shutoff pin. Of course, if it is not able to be stopped unless the traffic stop if over, then the car can just tell the cop that on the display, then the former situation is avoided. Both good options though.)",6475,2020-06-26 10:04:58,222

Some wisdom from /u/Altimas

>   Keep in mind this truck is going to look 'different'.  Many people complained about many of the aspects about the Model 3 when it was revealed.  They hated the fact there was no instrument cluster.  They hated the door handles. They hated the look of the front end. Don't jump to conclusions, keep an open mind.

Musk‚Äôs tweets are holding me back,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gafhtu/musks_tweets_are_holding_me_back/,"I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm the only one but his continued tweets minimizing the risk of Coronavirus and pushing to open things back up are extremely concerning to me. I‚Äôve been a big fan of Tesla and Musk for several years and was just about to pull the trigger on a Model X when the virus hit. Financial stress was part of it but the bigger issue is that bright now he‚Äôs making me rethink my support of him and his company. It makes me very sad.

edit: Very interesting to see everyone's responses, particularly considering that this is such a polarizing topic. Glad to see that most people are still carrying out civil conversation even if differing in opinions. Many have made the great point that Musk's personal opinions do not equate to the total ""ethical value"" of Tesla as a whole and that long term supporting EV adoption is a huge net positive. Likewise, I acknowledge that single line tweets are likely a gross oversimplification of anyone's complete opinion. Overall his tweets have not and will not act as the sole determining factor in my eventual car purchase but as someone who believes the large majority of public health professionals I remain concerned by his expressed opinions, particularly given that he is such an influential figure.",6168,2020-04-30 07:09:49,251

Request: Tesla should install free air compressors at Supercharger sites for filling/checking tires,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e5nlld/request_tesla_should_install_free_air_compressors/,"I've not seen this discussed anywhere else so I thought I would point it out here that it would really be nice and make sense for Tesla to provide free air (think gas station air compressor) at most Supercharger locations.  I got a low tire pressure warning on my way to a Supercharger yesterday and later had to go find a gas station with an operating air compressor to fill up the tire.  Just a thought.  Not sure how to officially ask Tesla for this type of thing.

Edit:  Nice to see all the interest in this.  After all the feedback, I would edit my request to say it doesn't necessarily need to be provided free of charge,  just being available is good enough for me.  It would just be nice to have it as an option at a majority of Supercharger locations.   And if I have to pay for it, making it part of the existing billing system already in place would be fantastic!",4976,2019-12-04 10:03:08,360

I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gzzj5h/i_returned_my_model_y_back_to_tesla_full/,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days. He was very nice and professional, but couldn't offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by Customer Service leaders at the company. ",4792,2020-06-10 11:57:57,381

"Tesla is banned from /r/technology, and so am I for finding out",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/21lurz/tesla_is_banned_from_rtechnology_and_so_am_i_for/,"Stories about Tesla have been banned from /r/technology. And now that I've found out about it, I've been banned from r/technology, too.

I discovered this by posting a story about Tesla to r/technology. It was blocked, but that sort of thing happens, often inadvertently, so I asked the mods if they would unblock it. /u/agentlame responded that ""That's better suited for /r/teslamotors.""

Well, that's true, just as Google stories are best suited for r/google, Apple stories for r/apple, etc. But I replied by pointing out that Tesla stories [are very popular on /r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=tesla&sort=top&restrict_sr=on), getting thousands of upvotes and being among the subreddit's top-rated stories of all time. Agentlame replied:

>Battery cars aren't 'technolgy' any more than normal cars are. Brand favoritism isn't a good reason to allow something that doesn't belong.

But the idea that the electric (and [robotic](http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/17/teslas-autopilot-car-project-targets-90-percent-of-miles-driv/)) future of vehicle tech isn't a technology story is something that [multiple](http://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/) tech [sites](http://www.theverge.com/tag/tesla) that [cover](http://techcrunch.com/tag/tesla/) Tesla [seem](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aarstechnica.com+tesla&num=100) to [disagree](http://www.wired.com/business/tag/tesla/) with.

I was curious if this was just the whim of a single moderator, or a larger r/technology policy, so I looked for recent Tesla stories on r/technology.

[There are none.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=tesla&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)

Tesla stories were frequent until three months ago, at which point all Tesla submissions suddenly stopped, save for a single post that slipped through the filter by using the plural ""Teslas"" in the title. I asked Agentlame if Tesla had indeed been banned from r/technology.

His response:

>Car stories should be submitted to car-related subreddits.

>Please inform your supervisors in the Tesla Motors Marketing department.

And then, from the main /r/technology account:

>**you've been banned**

>you have been banned from posting to [/r/technology: Technology](/r/technology) .

Not only is Tesla banned from r/technology, but so am I for finding out about it.

For better or worse, all subreddits, even the main subreddits visible to everyone by default, are the private playgrounds of whoever started them first. So it's up to them what to allow and not allow. But subreddits tend to be very clear about their rules. Not only was this ban not transparent, but the anti-transparency theme extended so far as to actually ban someone for noticing what happened. That just seems impulsively vindictive. I hope that Agentlame or someone else at r/technology will reconsider. The largest share of my karma, over 25,000 of these made-up Reddit points we play with, has come from contributions I've made to r/technology. I'd like to continue the conversation.

And in case anyone thinks there must be more to this story, that I must privately be some insufferable internet troll and that I surely couldn't have been banned just for asking if Tesla was banned, [here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FbXBuKE.png) of my full conversation with Agentlame.",4697,2014-03-29 06:22:20,395

Smart Summon is mindblowing,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/da2m14/smart_summon_is_mindblowing/,"I know I know, we‚Äôve heard it a million times but seriously guys.

I just got back from testing out smart summon and it‚Äôs so insane to see your beautiful Tesla drive itself to you. Sure it‚Äôs not faster than 5MPH but honestly, that seems plenty fast when you‚Äôre not in the driver‚Äôs seat.

The added driving visualizations to the app are clever and smart, adding a sense of reassurance while your Tesla does its thing. It even tells you when it‚Äôs waiting for a pedestrian to finish crossing!

I think the cherry on top, though, is definitely the reactions you get. I had two people ask me as I was driving away if my car was driving itself and they were ecstatic when they heard me say yes. They told me how weird it was to see the car drive to me and then see me hop into the driver‚Äôs seat and drive off. I know from the two reactions alone, that it‚Äôll be the highlight of their days and mine.

Dare I say, summon is more than a party trick now.

Edit :
Here‚Äôs the letter I received 
https://i.imgur.com/zFcFOIs.jpg 

Edit for the uninformed:
Tesla offered a very limited 60 model. It was a known 75kw battery, software limited to lower the price and bump sales. It was cheaper and I didn‚Äôt need the extra miles so it sold me. 
It was an experiment by Tesla that worked but has been discontinued. 
They turned it on for all of us 60 owners in Florida to help out. I could have upgraded to a 75 anytime but chose not to. 
Very cool of them. ",4124,2017-09-10 03:56:21,495
