# MSA Data Phase 2  
Welcome to Phase 2 - Data Science of the MSA program! <br>
<br>
We will be focusing on sentiment analysis for Phase 2, and this will involve training your own classifier as well as using prebuilt sentiment models.
<br>

### What you will learn
* Data exploration and preparation using the NLTK package
* Sentiment analysis using the TextBlob and Vader libraries (part of NLTK)
* Sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Network
